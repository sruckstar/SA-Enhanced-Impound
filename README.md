# Improved Impound

In the early stages of development, Rockstar planned to introduce impound lots to the game, where the main character's cars would end up. In the final game, this idea resulted in a buggy script that saved absolutely all vehicles ever used by the player (including air and water) to the impound lot.

These bugs are partially fixed by SilentPatch. However, this mod completely overhauls this gameplay feature.


# Features of the mod

- Now only the protagonist's personal vehicle can get to the impound lot. By personal, we mean vehicles that were previously stored in the garage of any safehouse.
- After your vehicle is impounded, you will receive a notification and the impound lot icon will appear near the police station.
- Your personal vehicle will be stored for the duration of the game session, or until your other vehicle is impounded.


# Release Features

- The mod is written in GTA3Script, the language used to write all the gameplay scripts for the 3D series of GTA games.
- There is support for the classic GTA San Andreas as well as the Android version and the Definitive Edition.
